My Way (Fetty Wap)

(Let’s go)
state reforms wont you come my way?!
Got something i want to say!!
Cannot keep it out my brain! 
*But first of ima start by saying a list, aye!
*All governors, Wilson Roosevelt LaFollete, aye!
*And im too turnt, when i rap, swear i wont diss, aye!
State reforms won't you come my way?!
State reforms won't you come my way!?

(pause)

This is something you should know!, i dont ever stop on the gov!
Secret ballot, you have that glow ! Allows you to vote without them having to know!!
Choose whoever you want!! , new president, I know!!
Party bosses never take you out! barely voted for the house!
How dare state legislators run their mouth! when everything’s  all in doubt!
The next reform he put out! is ready to make it out!
*And it’s initiative introduce bills directly, ayy
*And its time to tell and say that their bills can pass, ayy
*Referendum could repeal unpopular laws, ayy
*Direct primary select your candidates now, ayee
*Get rid of officials before terms expire, ayye

State reforms wont you my way?! 
Got something i want to say!
Cannot keep it out my brain!
But first of ima start by saying a list, aye!
All governors, Wilson Roosevelt Lafollete, Aye!
And Im too turnt, when i rap, swear i wont diss, aye!
State reforms wont you come my way! (DAB)
